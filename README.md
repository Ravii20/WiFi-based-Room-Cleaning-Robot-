# WiFi-based-Room-Cleaning-Robot-
The microcontroller used is a R5F100LE which is a renasas microcontroller and the project is done in Cubesuite+ IDE.
The project connects to WiFi open hotspot with the name "clean" and waits for commands. for each command it recieves it performs curresponding action. like FF@ will trigger forward movement of the robot.
If an android app is made that can send these codes continuously then the robot can be made autonomos.provided we upload a map of the area onto the phone..that would be soooo cooooool :)

please do help me out in making this project of mine even better. Thank you in advance :)
